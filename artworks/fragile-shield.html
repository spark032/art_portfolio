                <p class="artwork-description">
                    This 3D sculpture represents the irrationality and absurdity of Korean superstition called aegttaem. When a plate breaks, it makes one feel unlucky, but at the same time, 
                    Koreans have a superstitious view that the event will stop worse things from occurring, believing it was an aegttaem. 
                    For this piece, I broke the plates by dropping them instead of hammering them to show the uncontrollability of superstition and to get shards from the "dropped" plates. 
                    The wearer of this shield made with broken plates may think that it will protect her from bad luck. I intended to highlight the irony of superstition that the very shards 
                    she regarded as a talismanic shield could actually harm her with their sharp edges. The duality of superstition is highlighted: it gives a sense of relief, but it also disguises the danger.
